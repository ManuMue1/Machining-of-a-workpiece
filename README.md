# Machining-of-a-workpiece
Machining virtual workpiece with holes, millings and other workpieces 

With a self-created linked list, workpieces can be created at any coordinates, which in turn can contain workpieces but also drilling and milling with any radius and also any length.  Workpieces, drillings and millings are called components, through which can be iterated with a self-built iterator. Additionally, the travelled path of the virtual drill tip can be calculated and this can also be optimized to the shortest possible. Which components with which properties are located on which level is then formatted and written to a json file.
